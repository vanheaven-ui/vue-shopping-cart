## About The Project

![Shopping cart Screen Shot](screenshot/screenshot.png)

The application herein was built to practice the use of Vue.js to build front end applications. The main features of the application include viewing a list of items available, a drawer that displays the details of each item when the view details button is clicked, ability to add and remove items from the cart, and the cart view/page with details of items in the cart. [This youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWt4jYThJCo) was the basis of the entire build and I would recommend it to any one that wants to practice some Vue.js. The next feature on the item is to build out an authentication so that several users can have different carts and profiles.
